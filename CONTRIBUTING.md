# Contributing
 
I explicitly welcome contributions from people who have never contributed to open-source before: we were all beginners once!
I can help build on a partially working pull request with the aim of getting it merged.
I am also actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome contributions from women from all backgrounds and people of color. <sup>[1](#References)</sup>

If you're interested in contributing, fork this repo and create a pull request.
Please include a short descriptive link to your code in the readme, and order the link alphpabetically by file name.
Include a description of each data structure or algorithm at the top of the file, and if you feel that your code needs further explanation,
you can include a more detailed summary in the Data Structures or Algorithms subfolder's readme.
Please follow the [Ruby](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) Style Guides.
Tests are recommended, but optional.
