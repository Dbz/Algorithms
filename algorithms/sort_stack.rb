# CtCI 6th Edition Problem 3.5
# Sort Stack: Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use
# an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure
# (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

class SortStack
  attr_reader :size

  def initialize
    @stack  = []
    @size   = 0
  end

  def push(el)
    @size += 1
    @stack << el
  end

  def pop
    return nil if empty?

    @size -= 1
    @stack.pop
  end

  def peek
    @stack.last
  end

  def empty?
    @size.zero?
  end

  # Sorts so that the smallest items are on top
  # Pops each element, and potentially pops each element back. Worst cash O(n^2) time complexity. 
  def sort
    return self if empty?

    temp = SortStack.new
    temp.push pop

    until empty?
      el = pop
      if el > temp.peek
        push temp.pop until temp.empty? || temp.peek <= el
      end
      temp.push el
    end
    temp
  end
end
